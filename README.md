# hello-world
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin' I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch


Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
